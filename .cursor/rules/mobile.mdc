When generating CSS styles, always follow these responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS:

Responsive Design Guidelines:
- Use mobile-first approach (Tailwind's default approach)
- Implement fluid typography and layouts
- Utilize Tailwind's responsive utility classes
- Ensure readability and usability across devices

Tailwind CSS Breakpoint Defaults:
- Mobile (default): up to 640px
- Tablet: 640px to 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px and above
- Large Screens: 1280px and above

Tailwind Responsive Prefix Syntax:
```jsx
<div className="
  w-full           // Base (mobile) width
  md:w-1/2         // Tablet width (640px+)
  lg:w-1/3         // Desktop width (1024px+)
  xl:w-1/4         // Large screen width (1280px+)
">
  {/* Responsive content */}
</div>
